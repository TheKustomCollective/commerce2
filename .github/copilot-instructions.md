# AI Coding Agent Instructions for `commerce2`

## Overview
`commerce2` is a project under active development. This document provides essential guidelines for AI coding agents to contribute effectively to the codebase.

## Project Structure
- The repository structure is minimal at this stage, with a `README.md` file as the only visible artifact.
- Additional context about the architecture, workflows, and conventions will need to be inferred or clarified as the project evolves.

## Guidelines for Contributions
1. **Understand the Scope**: Since the repository is in its early stages, prioritize creating foundational components and scaffolding.
2. **Follow Standard Practices**: Adhere to common conventions for the language and framework used (e.g., Python, JavaScript, etc.).
3. **Document Decisions**: Clearly document any assumptions or decisions made during implementation.

## Next Steps
- Collaborate with the team to define the architecture and workflows.
- Update this document as the project structure and conventions become clearer.
