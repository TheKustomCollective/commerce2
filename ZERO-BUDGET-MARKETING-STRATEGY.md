## Budget Reality Check

**True Cost**: While this strategy is "zero budget," there are time investments:

| Activity | Hours/Week | Hourly Value @ $50/hr | Weekly "Cost" |
|----------|------------|----------------------|---------------|

## Final Thoughts

This strategy requires **consistency over intensity**. You won't see overnight results, but if you execute 80% of this plan for 90 days, you WILL see growth.

**Keys to success**:
1. **Show up daily**: Content, engagement, community—be present
2. **Provide value first**: Never pitch without helping first
3. **Track everything**: Data tells you what's working
4. **Iterate fast**: If something isn't working in 2 weeks, try something new
5. **Build in public**: Share your journey—people root for founders they know

**Remember**: Every major SaaS company started with zero budget and a scrappy marketing strategy. You have better tools (AI, social media, no-code) than they did. The opportunity is there—you just have to execute.
