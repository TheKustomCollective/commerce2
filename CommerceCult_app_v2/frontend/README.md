## Getting Started

The CommerceCult App frontend is designed to work seamlessly with the backend service. Ensure that the backend is running before starting the frontend application.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Application

To start the frontend application in development mode, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the application, and you can access it in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Folder Structure

The `frontend/src` directory contains the following:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the application.
- `main.js`: The entry point for the JavaScript code.
- `components/`: A directory for reusable components.
