# CommerceCult (static site)

This is a minimal static site for the CommerceCult project. It is intended to be published with GitHub Pages and served at the custom domain `commercecult.app` (CNAME file is present).

Files added:
- `index.html` — landing page
- `style.css` — minimal styling
- `CNAME` — already present (commercecult.app)

To publish:
1. Add the deploy SSH key (provided earlier) as a repository deploy key with write access.
2. From this workspace I'll push the `main` branch to `git@github.com:TheKustomCollective/commerce2.git` and enable GitHub Pages.
